    "## Lecture 3: Nearest Neighbor Search and Similarity Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction to Nearest Neighbor Search\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Nearest Neighbor Search (NNS):\n",
    "Nearest Neighbor Search is a fundamental operation in many AI and machine learning applications. It is the process of finding the closest data points in a dataset to a given query data point. In the context of vector databases, it is used to find vectors that are most similar to the query vector based on certain similarity metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why Nearest Neighbor Search?\n",
    "Many AI systems rely on NNS to provide context-aware responses. For example:\n",
    "- In recommendation systems, we need to find products, songs, or movies that are similar to those a user has liked in the past.\n",
    "- In image retrieval, we look for images that are similar to a query image.\n",
    "- In natural language processing (NLP), we may want to find documents that are semantically close to a given query.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Similarity Metrics: The Foundation of Nearest Neighbor Search\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What are Similarity Metrics?\n",
    "Similarity metrics are mathematical measures used to quantify the \"closeness\" or \"similarity\" between two vectors. These metrics define how we compare vectors in high-dimensional space and determine which vectors are closest to each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Types of Similarity Metrics:\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 1. Cosine Similarity\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition:** Cosine similarity measures the cosine of the angle between two vectors. It focuses on the orientation (direction) of vectors rather than their magnitude (size), making it ideal for text and document comparison.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Formula:**\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{Cosine Similarity}(A,B) = \\frac{A \\cdot B}{||A|| ||B||}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Interpretation:**\n",
    "- Ranges from -1 (completely opposite) to 1 (completely similar).\n",
    "- A value of 0 indicates no similarity.\n",
    "- A value of 1 indicates identical vectors in terms of direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 2. Euclidean Distance\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition:** Euclidean distance is the straight-line distance between two vectors in high-dimensional space. It works well for continuous-valued vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Formula:**\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{Euclidean Distance}(A,B) = \\sqrt{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} (A_i - B_i)^2}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Interpretation:**\n",
    "- The smaller the distance, the more similar the vectors.\n",
    "- This is the classic \"distance\" measure used in geometry.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 3. Manhattan Distance (L1 Norm)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition:** Manhattan distance measures the sum of the absolute differences of coordinates. Also known as the L1 norm.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Formula:**\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{Manhattan Distance}(A,B) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} |A_i - B_i|\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Interpretation:**\n",
    "- It is more sensitive to differences in individual dimensions compared to Euclidean distance.\n",
    "- Useful when each dimension has equal importance.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 4. Hamming Distance\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition:** Hamming distance is the number of positions at which the corresponding elements are different between two strings or vectors of equal length.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Formula:**\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{Hamming Distance}(A,B) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\text{indicator}(A_i \\neq B_i)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Interpretation:**\n",
    "- Commonly used for binary or categorical data, such as DNA sequence comparison or binary classification tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 5. Jaccard Similarity\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition:** The Jaccard similarity coefficient measures the proportion of the intersection of two sets to the union of those sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Formula:**\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{Jaccard Similarity}(A,B) = \\frac{|A \\cap B|}{|A \\cup B|}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Interpretation:**\n",
    "- Ranges from 0 (no similarity) to 1 (complete similarity).\n",
    "- Often used in document similarity tasks where sets are collections of words or terms.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How Nearest Neighbor Search Works\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Vector Representation\n",
    "In most machine learning tasks, data is transformed into vectors (embeddings). These embeddings represent the data points in a high-dimensional space where the distance or similarity between vectors corresponds to the degree of similarity between the original data points.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Search Process:\n",
    "1. Each data point is embedded as a vector.\n",
    "2. A query vector is generated.\n",
    "3. The algorithm calculates the similarity between the query vector and all the vectors in the database.\n",
    "4. The algorithm returns the nearest neighbors (the closest vectors).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Brute Force vs. Approximate Search:\n",
    "- **Brute Force Search:** Compares the query vector to every vector in the database. Guarantees exact nearest neighbors but is computationally expensive for large datasets.\n",
    "- **Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN):** Uses algorithms like Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH) or HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World) to approximate nearest neighbors. While not always exact, ANN provides significant speed improvements for large-scale datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Efficient Nearest Neighbor Search Algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. K-D Trees\n",
    "- A K-D tree is a binary tree where every node is a K-dimensional point.\n",
    "- It recursively divides the data into two halves at each level.\n",
    "- Efficient for nearest neighbor searches in lower dimensions (up to 20-30).\n",
    "- **Limitation:** Becomes inefficient in high-dimensional spaces due to the \"curse of dimensionality.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Ball Trees\n",
    "- Ball trees partition the dataset using spherical regions rather than hyperplanes.\n",
    "- Suitable for high-dimensional data but still suffers from inefficiencies as dimensions grow.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Approximate Nearest Neighbors (ANN)\n",
    "- **HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World):** A graph-based approach that creates a multi-layered graph where nodes represent data points and edges represent similarities.\n",
    "- **Advantage:** Very efficient for high-dimensional spaces and large datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Practical Applications of Nearest Neighbor Search\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Recommendation Systems\n",
    "- A user's past behavior (e.g., product views, purchases) is represented as a vector.\n",
    "- NNS finds similar products or users with similar preferences.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Image and Video Retrieval\n",
    "- Images or videos are embedded as vectors.\n",
    "- NNS retrieves the most similar images or videos from a large database.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Semantic Search\n",
    "- Search engines use NNS to find documents or web pages semantically similar to a query.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Anomaly Detection\n",
    "- NNS can detect anomalies by identifying data points that are far from their nearest neighbors, indicating outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. Natural Language Processing (NLP)\n",
    "- Helps find similar documents, detect paraphrases, and retrieve relevant information for question-answering tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "- **Efficient Search in AI Systems:** NNS is essential for modern AI applications requiring fast retrieval of similar data points.\n",
    "- **Real-Time Performance:** Approximate nearest neighbor algorithms enable real-time, large-scale AI applications requiring fast search and retrieval.\n"
