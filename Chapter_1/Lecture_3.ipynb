    "# Lecture 3: AI Model Lifecycle â€“ From Training to Deployment\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The AI model lifecycle covers every stage of an AI systemâ€™s developmentâ€”from data preparation and model training to deployment and continuous monitoring. Unlike traditional software, which follows predefined logic, AI models learn from data and require constant updates, retraining, and monitoring to remain effective.\n",
    "\n",
    "This lecture explores:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Model Training** â€“ How AI models learn from data.\n",
    "2. **Model Evaluation & Optimization** â€“ Improving performance before deployment.\n",
    "3. **Model Deployment** â€“ Turning models into real-world AI applications.\n",
    "4. **MLOps & Continuous Learning** â€“ Maintaining AI systems post-deployment.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end, you will understand how to build and manage AI models at scale.\n",
